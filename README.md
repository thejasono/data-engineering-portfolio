# Data Engineering Series

This is a hands-on series of projects and walkthroughs designed to explain **data engineering concepts** in a practical way.  
Each project is paired with a blog post that introduces the theory and then shows a working example with code.

The goal is twofold:
1. Help newcomers understand what data engineering *actually* involves.
2. Build a portfolio of clear, reproducible projects that demonstrate industry skills.
